# odin-recipes

This is my solution to the Recipes project in the Odin Project's Foundations course. Completion of this project demonstrates proficiency in using basic HTML semantics to create text, links, images, and lists, and in basic Git usage.

My solution features recipes for fettuccine alfredo, gyros, and miso soup.
